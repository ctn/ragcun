# Processed Data Directory

This directory contains processed and cleaned documents ready for embedding and retrieval.

Documents here should be:
- Cleaned and normalized
- Split into appropriate chunks
- Formatted consistently

The processing pipeline typically:
1. Reads raw documents from `data/raw/`
2. Cleans and normalizes text
3. Splits into chunks
4. Saves processed chunks here
