# Embeddings Directory

This directory stores vector embeddings generated from processed documents.

Embeddings are numerical representations of documents that capture semantic meaning,
enabling efficient similarity search and retrieval.

Files here are typically:
- Saved as numpy arrays (`.npy`)
- Indexed with FAISS or similar vector databases
- Associated with metadata about the source documents
