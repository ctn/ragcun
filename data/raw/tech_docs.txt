Microservices communicate through well-defined APIs and enable organizations to develop and deploy services independently, improving agility and resilience.
Continuous Integration (CI) is a development practice where developers integrate code into a shared repository frequently, preferably several times a day. Each integration is verified by automated build and automated tests to detect integration errors quickly. CI helps teams detect problems early, reduce integration problems, and develop cohesive software more rapidly.
Continuous Deployment (CD) is a software release process that uses automated testing to validate changes and automatically deploy them to production. CD extends continuous integration by deploying all code changes to a testing and/or production environment after the build stage. This practice enables rapid, reliable, and repeatable software releases.
Agile is a software development methodology that emphasizes iterative development, collaboration, and flexibility. Agile teams work in short sprints, deliver working software frequently, and adapt to changing requirements. The Agile Manifesto values individuals and interactions over processes and tools, working software over comprehensive documentation, and responding to change over following a plan.
Scrum is an Agile framework for managing complex projects, particularly software development. It defines roles (Product Owner, Scrum Master, Development Team), events (Sprint, Sprint Planning, Daily Scrum, Sprint Review, Sprint Retrospective), and artifacts (Product Backlog, Sprint Backlog, Increment).
