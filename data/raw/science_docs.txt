Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants and certain other organisms convert light energy into chemical energy. During photosynthesis, plants use sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide to produce glucose and oxygen. This process occurs in chloroplasts and is fundamental to life on Earth, as it produces oxygen and forms the base of most food chains.
DNA (Deoxyribonucleic Acid) is a molecule that carries genetic instructions for the development, functioning, growth, and reproduction of all known organisms. DNA is composed of two strands forming a double helix structure, with each strand made of nucleotides containing a sugar, phosphate, and nitrogenous base. The sequence of these bases encodes genetic information.
Evolution is the process by which populations of organisms change over successive generations through mechanisms like natural selection, genetic drift, and mutation. Charles Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection explains how species adapt to their environments over time. Evolution is supported by evidence from fossils, genetics, anatomy, and biogeography.
Neurons are specialized cells that transmit electrical and chemical signals throughout the nervous system. Each neuron consists of a cell body, dendrites that receive signals, and an axon that sends signals to other neurons. Neurons communicate through synapses using neurotransmitters, enabling complex processes like thinking, memory, and movement.
The Big Bang theory is the prevailing cosmological model explaining the universe's origin from an extremely hot and dense initial state approximately 13.8 billion years ago. The universe has been expanding and cooling ever since. Evidence includes cosmic microwave background radiation, the abundance of light elements, and the observed expansion of the universe.
Black holes are regions of spacetime where gravity is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape from inside the event horizon. They form when massive stars collapse at the end of their life cycles. Black holes can be detected through their effects on nearby matter and gravitational waves. They come in different sizes: stellar, intermediate, and supermassive.
Quantum mechanics is the fundamental theory in physics that describes nature at the smallest scales of energy levels of atoms and subatomic particles. It introduces concepts like wave-particle duality, uncertainty principle, and quantum entanglement. Quantum mechanics has led to technologies like transistors, lasers, and is the basis for quantum computing.
General relativity is Einstein's theory of gravitation that describes gravity not as a force, but as a consequence of the curvature of spacetime caused by mass and energy. It predicts phenomena like gravitational time dilation, gravitational lensing, and gravitational waves. GPS satellites must account for relativistic effects to maintain accuracy.
Climate change refers to long-term shifts in global temperatures and weather patterns, primarily caused by human activities increasing greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere. The burning of fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes release carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. Effects include rising sea levels, extreme weather events, and ecosystem disruptions.
The periodic table is a tabular arrangement of chemical elements organized by atomic number, electron configuration, and recurring chemical properties. Elements are arranged in rows (periods) and columns (groups) with similar characteristics. The periodic table is a powerful tool for predicting element properties and understanding chemical reactions.
Antibiotics are medications that fight bacterial infections by killing bacteria or preventing their growth. They work through various mechanisms like interfering with cell wall synthesis, protein production, or DNA replication. However, antibiotic resistance has become a major global health threat due to overuse and misuse of these medications.
CRISPR-Cas9 is a revolutionary gene-editing technology that allows scientists to precisely modify DNA sequences in living organisms. The system uses a guide RNA to direct the Cas9 enzyme to specific DNA locations for cutting. CRISPR has applications in treating genetic diseases, developing new crops, and advancing biological research.
Plate tectonics is the scientific theory explaining the movement of Earth's lithosphere, which is divided into large plates floating on the semi-fluid asthenosphere. Plate movements cause earthquakes, volcanic activity, mountain building, and ocean trench formation. The theory unified many geological phenomena and revolutionized Earth sciences.
Thermodynamics is the branch of physics dealing with heat, work, temperature, and energy relationships. The laws of thermodynamics govern energy transformations: the first law (energy conservation), the second law (entropy increase), and the third law (absolute zero). These principles apply to engines, refrigerators, and all energy systems.
Ecosystems are communities of living organisms interacting with their physical environment. They involve energy flow through food chains and nutrient cycling. Ecosystems can range from small ponds to entire biomes. Understanding ecosystems is crucial for conservation, managing natural resources, and predicting environmental changes.
Vaccines are biological preparations that provide immunity to specific infectious diseases. They typically contain weakened or killed forms of pathogens, their toxins, or surface proteins. Vaccines stimulate the immune system to recognize and fight diseases without causing illness. Vaccination has eliminated or controlled many deadly diseases globally.
Nuclear fusion is the process by which two light atomic nuclei combine to form a heavier nucleus, releasing enormous amounts of energy. Fusion powers the sun and stars. Scientists are working to achieve controlled fusion on Earth as a clean, abundant energy source. The main challenge is creating conditions hot enough for fusion while containing the reaction.
Stem cells are undifferentiated cells capable of developing into many different cell types in the body. Embryonic stem cells are pluripotent, while adult stem cells are multipotent. Stem cell research promises treatments for various diseases, tissue regeneration, and understanding development and disease processes.
The immune system is a complex network of cells, tissues, and organs that defend the body against pathogens and foreign substances. It includes innate immunity (immediate, non-specific) and adaptive immunity (learned, specific). Components include white blood cells, antibodies, the lymphatic system, and specialized organs like the thymus and spleen.
Renewable energy comes from sources that are naturally replenished, including solar, wind, hydroelectric, geothermal, and biomass. Unlike fossil fuels, renewables don't deplete natural resources and produce little to no greenhouse gas emissions. Transitioning to renewable energy is crucial for combating climate change and ensuring sustainable development.
Nanotechnology is the manipulation of matter on an atomic and molecular scale, typically dealing with structures sized between 1 to 100 nanometers. Applications include medicine (drug delivery, diagnostics), electronics (smaller, faster devices), materials science (stronger, lighter materials), and energy (more efficient solar cells and batteries).
